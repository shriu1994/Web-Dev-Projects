# Python-Mini-Projects-02-Calculator

In this mini project, we will be using the input() function of Python. First we will ask user to enter choice of operation such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and divide. For this program, we will let the user input two numbers and  write program for prompt of the two numbers. 

Now, define the operators such as addition, multiplication, division and subtraction to our Calculator program. 

If we want to limit the program to only perform one operation at a time, we’ll have to use conditional statements and make the entire calculator program to be user’s choice based operation program.
